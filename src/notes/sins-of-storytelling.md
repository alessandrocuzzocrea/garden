1. **Lack of Clear Motivations**: Characters who act without clear motivations can feel inconsistent or unbelievable. It's essential that characters have reasons for their actions that align with their established personalities.

2. **Deus Ex Machina**: This refers to the sudden or unexpected introduction of a character, ability, or event that conveniently solves a problem. It often feels like a cheat to readers or viewers.

3. **Inconsistent World-Building**: If a story is set in a world with its own rules (like a fantasy or sci-fi setting), those rules need to be consistent. Changing them without explanation can break immersion.

4. **Flat Characters**: Characters who lack depth, growth, or complexity can be unengaging. Readers connect with characters who have strengths, flaws, desires, and fears.

5. **Overuse of Clichés**: While some clichés can be used effectively, relying on them too heavily can make a story feel unoriginal.

6. **Telling Instead of Showing**: As mentioned earlier, "show, don't tell" is a classic piece of writing advice. Instead of telling the reader how a character feels, it's generally more effective to show it through their actions, dialogue, and surroundings.

7. **Lack of Conflict**: Conflict drives narrative. A story without challenges, stakes, or obstacles can feel stagnant.

8. **Info Dumping**: As discussed in the previous questions, dropping large chunks of information, especially early on, can overwhelm or bore the reader.

9. **Poor Pacing**: Whether it's too fast and feels rushed or too slow and feels drawn out, pacing can greatly impact the engagement and enjoyment of a story.

10. **Unresolved Plot Threads**: If a narrative sets up questions or introduces subplots, they should be resolved by the end, or it can leave readers feeling unsatisfied.
