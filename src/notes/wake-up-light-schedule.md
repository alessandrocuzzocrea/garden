A **gradual wake-up light routine** I use to fake a sunrise alarm clock with smart LED bulbs.

The idea is to let light do the heavy lifting. 
Brightness ramps up slowly, and the color temperature shifts from warm amber to cold blue, roughly matching a real sunrise. 
The goal isn't to *shock* you awake, but to give your brain enough signals that waking up *happens gradually*.

I'm a **deep sleeper** and a **night owl**, so I find that when this is paired with a consistent bedtime, it makes waking up *way easier*.

Here are my settings:

| ⏰ Time to Alarm | 🔆 Brightness | 🌈 Color Temp | 🧠 Description                                                                                    |
| :-------------- | :----------- | :----------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| -60 min         | 1%           | 2000K        | A barely noticeable deep amber light, just enough to start nudging my brain without waking me up |
| -45 min         | 10%          | 2500K        | Shifts into candle-like tones as melatonin slowly starts backing off                             |
| -30 min         | 30%          | 3500K        | Lands on a normal warm white, usually when my sleep starts getting lighter                       |
| -15 min         | 60%          | 5000K        | Bright, clean white that feels like morning light and helps my body switch toward being awake    |
| -5 min          | 90%          | 7500K        | Strong blue-white light, usually enough to cut through any remaining heavy sleep                 |
| 0 min           | 100%         | 9000K        | Full brightness, cold blue light. At this point, staying in bed feels harder than getting up     |
