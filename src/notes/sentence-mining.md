The process of **sentence mining** is used to extract meaning from a text by looking at the relationships between the words in the text. This can be done by looking at the grammar of the sentence, the context in which the sentence is used, or by looking at the structure of the sentence.

**Sentence mining** can be useful for learning foreign languages, as it can help to identify the meaning of words and phrases in a text. It can also be used to help to understand the grammar of a foreign language.
