## Part 1 - Engines of Experience

- Game design -> creating rules
- Not any rules will do, most rules will generate a simple, repetitive patterns or just plain painful to learn and they will not make play that game an enjoyable experience.
- For example, Chess generates a perfect rhythm of puzzle and solutions, tension and release and that make the game more enjoyable/memorable.
- Game designer's job is to create such system of rules that create these kinds of results.
- ⚠️ Game design knowledge is a bunch of tools that games designer can use to achieve this result.
- Even with the best skills in the world, no designer can know the answer to every question. It's important to use other tools like testing, planning, and analysis process to verify your assumptions.
- It's important to understand the trade-off of your choices to avoid your game falling apart.

### Chapter 1. Engines of Experience

#### Mechanics and Events

- Games are made out *mechanics*.
- A mechanic is a game's rule, which defines how the game works.
- During gameplay, the player interact with the game and generates *events*.
- Events are generated during gameplay by the game's mechanics.
- Game designers don't design events directly.
- Game designers design the systems that generate events.

#### The Primacy of Emotion

- To hold the player's attention, events must provoke emotions.
- Emotions can be so subtle that players don't consciously detect them.
- Events in games can produce those small emotions.
- Emotions change constantly, and that change keep the game fresh and engaging.
- Detecting and understanding subtle emotions is it's hard to do and takes effort and practice but an essential designer's skill.
- Emotions are the reason why players spend energy, time and money to play the game.
- Emotions during gaming are not limited to "fun".

#### Emotional Triggers

- How do events create emotions?
- Human mind triggers an emotional response when certain conditions are met.
- An *emotional trigger* is something that causes emotion.

#### Emotion and Change

- To provoke emotion, an event must change some *human value*.
- The greater the change in human value, the stronger the emotion.
- A human value is anything that is important to people that can shift through multiple states. E.g. life/death, victory/defeat, wealth/poverty, etc.
- Changing human values can exist within the game or in real life.
- Minor events can be very emotional if they carry important implications.
- Emotions also appear in expectation of change.
- Information reveal is emotionally equivalent to change.
- A game can create human value shift by revealing or hiding informations.

#### The Emotional Black Box

- Emotion is a goal of game design but it is hard to track its precise origins because emotional triggers emotions are automatically handled by the unconscious mind.

##### The Bridge

- Classic experiment about the misattribution of emotions. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misattribution_of_arousal#Experiment

##### Emotional Misattribution

- *Emotional misattribution* happens constantly.
- Emotional misattribution can be used in a manipulative way.
- Our minds try to rationalize our emotions constantly -- and often in the wrong way.
- Emotional misattribution makes it difficult to determine the specific triggers of emotions in games as they present a complex array of stimuli and decisions.
- Designing games is hard because we can't see inside people's heads and know exactly how they feel when they play the game, making it difficult to determine emotional triggers.
- Game design requires theorizing at a distance using evidence-based methods and playtesting, but it's still tricky to get it just right.
