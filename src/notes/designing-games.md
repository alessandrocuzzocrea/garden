## Part 1 - Engines of Experience

### Engines of Experience
- Game design -> creating rules
- Not any rules will do, most rules will generate a simple, repetitive patterns or just plain painful to learn and they will not make play that game an enjoyable experience.
- For example, Chess generates a perferct rhythm of puzzle and solutions, tension and release and that make the game more enjoyable/memorable.
- Game designer's job is to create such system of rules that create these kinds of results.
- ⚠️ Game design knowledge is a bunch of tools that games designer can use to achieve this result.
- Even with the best skills in the world, no designer can know the answer to every question. It's important to use other tools like testing, planning, and analysis process to verify your assumptions.
- It's important to understand the trade-off of your choices to avoid your game falling apart.
