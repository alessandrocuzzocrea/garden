These settings help enforce better coding practices by notifying you of untyped or unassigned variables during development:

- Open your Godot project.  
- Navigate to **Project** > **Project Settings** in the top menu.  
- In the Project Settings window, enable **Advanced Settings** by clicking the gear icon.  
- Go to **Debug** > **GDScript** in the left-hand menu.  
- Adjust the following settings to control the strictness of type checking:  
  - **Untyped Declaration**: Set to either `Warning` or `Error`.  
- (Optional) Explore other settings in the **Debug** > **GDScript** category to further customize script debugging behavior.  
- Click **Close** to save your changes.
